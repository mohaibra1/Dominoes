<p></p><h5 id="description">Description</h5><p>You can't have a game without rules. It's time to introduce them!</p><p>Until now, the players were able to place their dominoes however they like. Now, it is considered a violation. According to the rules, the numbers on the ends of the two neighboring dominoes must match each other. This rule can also be described as a set of two requirements:</p><ol><li><p>A player cannot add a domino to the end of the snake if it doesn't contain the matching number.</p></li><li><p>The orientation of the newly added domino ensures that the matching numbers are neighbors.</p></li></ol><p>For example, consider the following situation:</p><p>We have a <code class="java">[3,4],[4,4],[4,2]</code> snake and a <code class="java">[1,2]</code> domino. The domino cannot be added to the left side of the snake because there is no 3 in <code class="java">[1,2]</code>. However, the domino can be added to the right side of the snake because <code class="java">[1,2]</code> contains a 2. If we were to place the domino on the right side of the snake, we would have to reorient it: <code class="java">[3,4],[4,4],[4,2],[2,1]</code>.<br/><br/>These two requirements are strict for both the player and the computer.</p><h5 id="objectives">Objectives</h5><p>Add the following functionality to your code. When it's a player's turn, the program should:</p><ol><li><p>Verify that the move entered by the player is legal (requirement #1).<br/>If not, request a new input with the following message: <code class="java">Illegal move. Please try again.</code>.</p></li><li><p>Place dominoes with the correct orientation (requirement #2).</p></li></ol><p>When it's a computer's turn, the program should:</p><ol><li><p>Try random moves until it finds a legal one.<br/></p><div class="alert alert-primary"><p>A set of possible moves ranges from <code class="java">-computer_size</code> to <code class="java">computer_size</code> (where the <code class="java">computer_size</code> is the number of dominoes the computer still has). Skipping a turn (move 0) is always legal.</p></div></li><li><p>Place dominoes with the correct orientation.</p></li></ol><div class="alert alert-primary"><p>The end-game condition can be achieved in two ways:</p><ol><li><p style="text-align: revert;">One of the players runs out of pieces. The first player to do so is considered a winner.</p></li><li><p style="text-align: revert;">The numbers on the ends of the snake are identical and appear within the snake 8 times. For example, the snake below will satisfy this condition:<code class="java">[5,5],[5,2],[2,1],[1,5],[5,4],[4,0],[0,5],[5,3],[3,6],[6,5]</code>If this condition is satisfied, it is no longer possible to go on with this snake. Essentially, the game has come to a permanent stop, so we have a draw.</p></li></ol></div><h5 id="examples">Examples</h5><p>The greater-than symbol followed by a space (<code class="java">&gt; </code>) represents the user input.
